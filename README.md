# Object_detection_AI_Fitness_Test

Welcome to the `Object_detection_AI_Fitness_Test` project repository! This project utilizes YOLOv7 for real-time object detection. Specifically, we have fine-tuned the model to detect volleyballs and medicine balls using the YOLOv7-tiny variant, ensuring rapid and real-time detection capabilities.

**Key Feature**: Real-time volleyball detection, making it ideal for monitoring sports events or training sessions.
